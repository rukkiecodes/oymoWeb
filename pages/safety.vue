    <h1 class="text-h5 text-sm-h4 text-md-h3 grey--text text--darken-4 font-weight-bold">Community Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Welcome to the Oymo community. If you’re honest, kind and respectful to others, you’ll always be welcome here. If you choose not to be, you may not last. Our goal is to allow users to express themselves freely as long as it doesn’t offend others. Everyone is held to the same standard on Oymo. We’re asking you to be considerate, think before you act, and abide by our community guidelines both on and offline. You heard that right: your offline behavior can lead to termination of your Oymo account.
    </p>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Below is a list of our community policies. If you violate any of these policies, you might be banned from Oymo. Seriously, don’t make us Swipe Left on you—because there will be no do-overs once we do. We encourage you to report any behavior that violates our policies, and read up on our Safety Tips.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-h6 text-sm-h5 grey--text text--darken-4 font-weight-bold">Oymo is not for:</h1>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Nudity/Sexual Content</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">We’re not asking you to comb your hair to one side or even speak in full sentences; but please keep it classy and appropriate for public consumption. No nudity, no sexually explicit content, and don’t chronicle all of your sexual desires in your bio. Keep it clean.</p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Harassment</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">Do not engage, or encourage others to engage, in any targeted abuse or harassment against any other user. This includes sending any unsolicited sexual content to your matches. Reports of stalking, threats, bullying, or intimidation, are taken very seriously.</p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Violence and Physical Harm</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      We do not tolerate violent, graphic, or gory content on Oymo, or any actions or content that advocate for or threaten violence of any sort, including threatening or promoting terrorism. Physical assault, coercion, and any acts of violence are strictly prohibited.<br /><br />
      Content that advocates for or glorifies suicide or self-harm is also not allowed. In these situations, we may take a number of steps to assist the user, including reaching out with crisis resources.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Hate Speech</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Any content that promotes, advocates for, or condones racism, bigotry, hatred, or violence against individuals or groups based on factors like (but not limited to) race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability, gender, age, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity is not allowed.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Private Information</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Don’t publicly broadcast any private information, yours or anyone else’s. This includes social security numbers, passports, passwords, financial information or unlisted contact information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, home/work address.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Spam</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Don’t be fake. Be real instead. Don’t use Oymo to drive people to external websites via a link or otherwise.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Promotion or Solicitation</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Soliciting other users is prohibited on Oymo. It’s fine to invite your matches to something that you’re doing, but if the purpose of your profile is to advertise your event or business, non-profit, political campaign, contest, or to conduct research, we may delete your account. While we’re excited that you’re doing a comedy show next week, please don’t use Oymo to promote it.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Prostitution and Trafficking</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Promoting or advocating for commercial sexual services, human trafficking or other non-consensual sexual acts is strictly prohibited and will result in your account being banned from Oymo.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Scamming</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Oymo has a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior of any kind. Anyone attempting to get other users’ private information for fraudulent or illegal activity may be banned. Any user caught sharing their own financial account information (PayPal, Venmo, etc.) for the purpose of receiving money from other users may also be banned from Oymo.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Impersonation</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Be yourself! Don’t pretend to be someone else.<br /><br />
      Do not impersonate, or otherwise misrepresent affiliation, connection or association with, any person or entity. This includes parody accounts. While we think your Mike Pence profile is hilarious, you aren’t Mike Pence. And if you are, what are you doing on Oymo?
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Minors</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      You must be 18 years of age or older to use Oymo. As such, we do not allow images of unaccompanied minors. If you want to post photos of your children, please make sure that you are in the photo as well. If you see a profile that includes an unaccompanied minor, encourages harm to a minor, or depicts a minor in a sexual or suggestive way, please report it immediately.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Copyright and Trademark Infringement</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      If it’s not yours, don’t post it. If your Oymo profile includes any work that is copyrighted or trademarked by others, don’t display it, unless you are allowed to do so.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Illegal Usage</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Don’t use Oymo to do anything illegal. If it’s illegal IRL, it’s illegal on Oymo.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">One Person, One Account</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Oymo accounts cannot have multiple owners, so don’t create an account with your friend or significant other. Additionally, please don’t maintain multiple Oymo accounts.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Third Party Apps</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      The use of any apps created by anyone other than Oymo that claim to offer our service or unlock special Oymo features (like auto-swipers) is not allowed.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-body-1 grey--text text--darken-3 font-weight-bold">Account Dormancy</h1>
    <p class="grey--text text--darken-2">
      Oymo is fun to use... all the time! Use Oymo at the lake, use Oymo while eating cake. Use Oymo when you’re out, use Oymo when in doubt! But, if you don’t log in to your Oymo account in 2 years, we may delete your account for inactivity.
    </p>
